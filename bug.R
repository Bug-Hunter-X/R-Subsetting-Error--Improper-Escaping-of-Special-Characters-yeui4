```r
# This code attempts to subset a data frame using a character vector that contains
# special characters.  The subsetting operation fails due to improper escaping of
# special characters.

df <- data.frame(col1 = c("a", "b", "c"), col2 = c(1, 2, 3))

# Incorrect subsetting - special character not escaped correctly
subset_incorrect <- df[df$col1 == "a\\"", ]
print(subset_incorrect)

# Correct subsetting - special character escaped correctly
subset_correct <- df[df$col1 == "a\"", ]
print(subset_correct)
