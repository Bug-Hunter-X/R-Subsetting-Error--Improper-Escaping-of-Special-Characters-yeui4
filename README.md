# R Subsetting Bug: Special Character Escaping

This repository demonstrates a common but subtle bug in R related to incorrect escaping of special characters when subsetting data frames.  The bug arises from the improper handling of backslashes and other special characters within character vectors used for subsetting.

The `bug.R` file contains code that reproduces the issue.  The `bugSolution.R` file provides a corrected version with the proper escaping technique.

## Bug Description

When subsetting a data frame using a character vector that includes special characters like backslashes, it is crucial to escape them correctly.  Failure to do so leads to incorrect subsetting, potentially returning an empty data frame or causing an error.

## Bug Solution

The solution involves correctly escaping the special characters using double backslashes or other appropriate escaping mechanisms depending on the character used.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.R` and run the code. Observe the incorrect output.
3. Open `bugSolution.R` and run the code. Observe the corrected output.
